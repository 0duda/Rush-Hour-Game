# Rush Hour Game - Project
This project is an implementation of the classic **Rush Hour puzzle game**, developed as part of the *Elements of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science* course (BSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, University of Porto, 2023/2024).

## Authors
* Eduarda Neves
* Gonçalo Pereira
* Inês Castro  

##  Search Algorithms
- **Uninformed**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).  
- **Informed**: Greedy Best-First Search, A*.
  
Algorithms return the list of moves that lead to the solution (or `None` if unsolvable).

## About the repository:
You will find four files, each implementing a different algorithm, a file for building the game board, another listing the various levels, and a start script that serves as the text-based interface in the terminal. Additionally, there is a README summarizing the project and the assignment file.

## How to Run
To run the game you need to enter the project directory and run:
```bash
python3 start_terminal.py
